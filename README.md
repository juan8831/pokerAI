# Kuhn Poker AI

In this project, I created an agent for playing 3-player Kuhn poker. My approach consists in utilizing Nash equilibrium parameter values from one of three possible subfamilies. I use these probabilities values to guide the decision making process for the agent. To create the agent, I used a Nash equilibrium proÔ¨Åle, which guarantees a worst-case payoff when playing against other players that are not playing with the same equilibrium subfamily.
